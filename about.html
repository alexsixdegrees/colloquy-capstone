	<h2>Two Main Functions of Applicationask.com</h2>
<!-- 	<button type="button">Add</button> -->
	<p></br>
		There would be two main functions of applicationask.com: </br></br>
1. Chat-box Q & A: a chat box that allows students to "chat" with the website to answer their questions. The website would be able to answer by identifying key-words in the questions
</br></br>
2. College Inform: This function would automatically gather and provide information of colleges from valid and approved websites for students, helping them avoid a waste of time on wrong information. It would also offer experience from other students in these colleges from forums like Zhihu to help students have a holistic view of the college.
</br></br>
		
	</p>
	<h2>Specific Goals and Ways to achieve</h2>
	<p>
		</br>
		The website would look like a "Wechat" chat page. Students can enter their questions like: "When should I start filling in the UC application?"" or "What is the supplemental essay for Cornell University?"
		</br></br>
		Numerous key words will be set in the database. If there is a key word matching the questions, related answers would pop up. According to the actual questions raised by the students, I would continue to update the key words.
		</br></br>
	</p>
	<h3>Sample Questions & Keywords & Answers:</h3></br>
	<p>
	>	Q: “When should I start to fill in the UC application?”</br>
	>	Keywords: UC, application, when</br>
	>	A: The UC application would end in 01/12. It is suggested to start the application before November. Visit UC  </br>
	>	website for further details:</br>   
	>	https://admissions.universityofcalifornia.edu/applicant/login.html</br></br>
	>	Q: “What is the deadline of the early decision of NYU?”</br>
	>	Keywords: Early Decision, NYU, deadline</br>
	>	A: The Early Decision for NYU ends in November the First, and the result would be available online in 15/12. 	 Visit NYU website for further details:</br> 
	> 	https://www.nyu.edu/</br></br>
	</p>
	<h2>Information Gathering</h2></br>
	<p>
	The College Inform functions would, after cross-comparing and referencing all the data, provide students with the information of top 40 colleges from several websites that offers trust-worthy data along with official websites:</br></br>
	> Common Data Set: </br>
	> http://collegelists.pbworks.com/w/page/30192726/Common%20Data%20Sets</br></br>
	> Official websites: (example)</br>
	> www.cornell.edu</br></br>
	> College Board School Data</br>
	> https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org</br></br>
	> College Data</br>
	> https://www.collegedata.com</br></br>
The information gathered will include: the first quartile and third quartile of SAT scores, average TOEFL score, admission rate, total student applied, total student admitted, how the admitted population was made up of and so on. </br></br>
It would be easier for students to get valid and proved information through this function rather than blindly searching on the Internet. </br></br>
The website will be powered by the GitHub server (which is free and just like this one).
