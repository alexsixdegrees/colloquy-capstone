     <h2>Identification of the problem:</h2>
     </br>
     <p>Check out my <a href="about.html">about page</a> to see the reason and goals behind this project.</p>
     </br>

     <h2>Planning and Process:</h2>
     </br>
     <p>A fair amount of coding and an understanding of web-development are needed. Also, I need to talk with my fellow students and the college counsiling teachers to understand what they needed the most during the applicaiton process.</p>
     </br>

    <h2>Verification of updates:</h2>
    </br>
    <p>Check out my three updates:</br> <a href="first-update.html"> 1. update to my project's goal</a> </br> <a href="second-update.html"> 2. update the UI Design of applicationask.com </a></br> <a href="third-update.html">3. screen-shots of my codes </a></p>
    </br>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    </br>
    <p>Til now (04.07), I have finished most of the functionality of the Q & A page. It is able to provide lots of basic information of different universities, including SAT range, Essay topics, school description, application deadline, and etc. It has a slight difference in UI with my original design.  </p>
    </br>
    <img src="image/demo1.png" alt="screenshots" style="width:80%;">
    </br>
    <p>The code behind the webpage:</p>
    <img src="image/demo2.png" alt="screenshots" style="width:80%;">    
    <img src="image/demo3.png" alt="screenshots" style="width:80%;"> 
    </br>
    </br>
        
    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    </br>
    <p> Building a website on one's own and be a full-stack developer is exhausting as it requires knowing different sets of tools so as to design / build / serve / test the website. </p>
    <p>However, having the ability to quickly turn your idea into a testable product and try it in the reality is worthy of all those efforts. It helps you to put your product into perspectives and learn its advantages / disadvantages quickly.</p>
