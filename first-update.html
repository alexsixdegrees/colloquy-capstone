<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>According to my observation, students tend to have trouble coming up their school list. Thus, integrating a function that can help students to choose their school according to their intended major, gpa, sat, toefl, activity, and other accomplishment would be a good idea.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>Students need to input their highest sat score, their highest toefl score, and their averaged gpa. Then, they need to choose the activity they have done from a range of activity and the level of those activities. Finally, they would need to choose the accomplishment they gained during their high school year. The School List Function would generate a result, a list of school, back to the students once they finish uploading their information. </p>

<p>The list of school would just be a reference for the students to improve their choices.</p>

<h2>When will the function be published</h2>

<p>The function would be published together with the college info function.</p>
